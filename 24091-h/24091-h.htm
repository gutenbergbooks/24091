</div>
<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">n the</span> seven centuries
that had elapsed since
the Second Empire had
been founded on the
shattered remnants of
the First, the nobles of the Imperium
had come slowly to realize that the
empire was not to be judged by the
examples of its predecessor. The
First Empire had conquered most of
the known universe by political intrigue
and sheer military strength; it
had fallen because that same propensity
for political intrigue had gained
over every other strength of the Empire,
and the various branches and
sectors of the First Empire had
begun to use it against one another.</p>

<p>The Second Empire was politically
unlike the First; it tried to balance a
centralized government against the
autonomic governments of the various
sectors, and had almost succeeded
in doing so.</p>

<p>But, no matter how governed,
there are certain essentials which are
needed by any governmental organization.</p>

<p>Without power, neither Civilization
nor the Empire could hold itself
together, and His Universal Majesty,
the Emperor Carl, well knew it. And
power was linked solidly to one element,
one metal, without which Civilization
would collapse as surely as
if it had been blasted out of existence.
Without the power metal, no
ship could move or even be built;
without it, industry would come to a
standstill.</p>

<p>In ancient times, even as far back
as the early Greek and Roman civilizations,
the metal had been known,
but it had been used, for the most
part, as decoration and in the manufacture
of jewelry. Later, it had been
coined as money.</p>

<p>It had always been relatively rare,
but now, weight for weight, atom for
atom, it was the most valuable element
on Earth. Indeed, the most
valuable in the known universe.</p>

<p>The metal was Element Number
Seventy-nine&mdash;gold.</p>

<p>To the collective mind of the Empire,
gold was the prime object in
any kind of mining exploration. The
idea of drilling for petroleum, even
if it had been readily available, or of
mining coal or uranium would have
been dismissed as impracticable and
even worse than useless.</p>

<p>Throughout the Empire, research
laboratories worked tirelessly at the
problem of transmuting commoner
elements into Gold-197, but thus far
none of the processes was commercially
feasible. There was still, after
thousands of years, only one way to
get the power metal: extract it from
the ground.</p>

<p>So it was that, across the great
gulf between the worlds, ship after
ship moved in search of the metal
that would hold the far-flung colonies
of the Empire together. Every
adventurer who could manage to get
aboard was glad to be cooped up on
a ship during the long months it
took to cross the empty expanses,
was glad to endure the hardships on
alien terrain, on the chance that his
efforts might pay off a thousand or
ten thousand fold.</p>

<p>Of these men, a mere handful
were successful, and of these one or
two stand well above the rest. And
for sheer determination, drive, and
courage, for the will to push on toward
his goal, no matter what the
odds, a certain Commander Frank
had them all beat.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II</h2>

<p>Before you can get a picture of
the commander&mdash;that is, as far as his
personality goes&mdash;you have to get a
picture of the man physically.</p>

<p>He was enough taller than the
average man to make him stand out
in a crowd, and he had broad shoulders
and a narrow waist to match.
He wasn't heavy; his was the hard,
tough, wirelike strength of a steel
cable. The planes of his tanned face
showed that he feared neither exposure
to the elements nor exposure to
violence; it was seamed with fine
wrinkles and the thin white lines that
betray scar tissue. His mouth was
heavy-lipped, but firm, and the lines
around it showed that it was unused
to smiling. The commander could
laugh, and often did&mdash;a sort of roaring
explosion that burst forth suddenly
whenever something struck
him as particularly uproarious. But he
seldom just smiled; Commander
Frank rarely went halfway in anything.</p>

<p>His eyes, like his hair, were a deep
brown&mdash;almost black, and they were
set well back beneath heavy brows
that tended to frown most of the
time.</p>

<p>Primarily, he was a military man.
He had no particular flair for science,
and, although he had a firm
and deep-seated grasp of the essential
philosophy of the Universal Assembly,
he had no inclination towards
the kind of life necessarily
led by those who would become
higher officers of the Assembly. It
was enough that the Assembly was
behind him; it was enough to know
that he was a member of the only
race in the known universe which
had a working knowledge of the essential,
basic Truth of the Cosmos.
With a weapon like that, even an ordinary
soldier had little to fear, and
Commander Frank was far from
being an ordinary soldier.</p>

<p>He had spent nearly forty of his
sixty years of life as an explorer-soldier
for the Emperor, and during
that time he'd kept his eyes open for
opportunity. Every time his ship had
landed, he'd watched and listened
and collected data. And now he
knew.</p>

<p>If his data were correct&mdash;and he
was certain that they were&mdash;he had
found his strike. All he needed was
the men to take it.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III</h2>

<p>The expedition had been poorly
outfitted and undermanned from the
beginning. The commander had been
short of money at the outset, having
spent almost all he could raise on his
own, plus nearly everything he could
beg or borrow, on his first two probing
expeditions, neither of which
had shown any real profit.</p>

<p>But they <i>had</i> shown promise; the
alien population of the target which
the commander had selected as his
personal claim wore gold as ornaments,
but didn't seem to think it
was much above copper in value, and
hadn't even progressed to the point
of using it as coinage. From the second
probing expedition, he had
brought back two of the odd-looking
aliens and enough gold to show that
there must be more where that came
from.</p>

<p>The old, hopeful statement,
"There's gold in them thar hills,"
should have brought the commander
more backing than he got, considering
the Empire's need of it and the
commander's evidence that it was
available; but people are always more
ready to bet on a sure thing than to
indulge in speculation. Ten years before,
a strike had been made in a
sector quite distant from the commander's
own find, and most of the
richer nobles of the Empire preferred
to back an established source of
the metal than to sink money into
what might turn out to be the pursuit
of a wild goose.</p>

<p>Commander Frank, therefore,
could only recruit men who were
willing to take a chance, who were
willing to risk anything, even their
lives, against tremendously long
odds.</p>

<p>And, even if they succeeded, the
Imperial Government would take
twenty per cent of the gross without
so much as a by-your-leave. There
was no other market for the metal
except back home, so the tax could
not be avoided; gold was no good
whatsoever in the uncharted wilds
of an alien world.</p>

<p>Because of his lack of funds, the
commander's expedition was not only
dangerously undermanned, but
illegally so. It was only by means of
out-and-out trickery that he managed
to evade the official inspection and
leave port with too few men and too
little equipment.</p>

<p>There wasn't a scientist worthy of
the name in the whole outfit, unless
you call the navigator, Captain Bartholomew,
an astronomer, which is
certainly begging the question. There
was no anthropologist aboard to
study the semibarbaric civilization of
the natives; there was no biologist
to study the alien flora and fauna.
The closest thing the commander
had to physicists were engineers who
could take care of the ship itself&mdash;specialist
technicians, nothing more.</p>

<p>There was no need for armament
specialists; each and every man was
a soldier, and, as far as his own
weapons went, an ordnance expert.
As far as Commander Frank was
concerned, that was enough. It had
to be.</p>

<p>Mining equipment? He took nothing
but the simplest testing apparatus.
How, then, did he intend to get
the metal that the Empire was
screaming for?</p>

<p>The commander had an answer
for that, too, and it was as simple as
it was economical. The natives would
get it for him.</p>

<p>They used gold for ornaments,
therefore, they knew where the gold
could be found. And, therefore, they
would bloody well dig it out for
Commander Frank.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV</h2>

<p>Due to atmospheric disturbances,
the ship's landing was several hundred
miles from the point the commander
had originally picked for the
debarkation of his troops. That
meant a long, forced march along
the coast and then inland, but there
was no help for it; the ship simply
wasn't built for atmospheric navigation.</p>

<p>That didn't deter the commander
any. The orders rang through the
ship: "All troops and carriers prepare
for landing!"</p>

<p>Half an hour later, they were assembled
outside the ship, fully armed
and armored, and with full field
gear. The sun, a yellow G-O star,
hung hotly just above the towering
mountains to the east. The alien air
smelled odd in the men's nostrils,
and the weird foliage seemed to
rustle menacingly. In the distance,
the shrieks of alien fauna occasionally
echoed through the air.</p>

<p>A hundred and eighty-odd men
and some thirty carriers stood under
the tropic blaze for forty-five minutes
while the commander checked over
their equipment with minute precision.
Nothing faulty or sloppy was
going into that jungle with him if
he could prevent it.</p>

<p>When his hard eyes had inspected
every bit of equipment, when he had
either passed or ordered changes in
the manner of its carrying or its condition,
when he was fully satisfied
that every weapon was in order&mdash;then,
and only then, did he turn his
attention to the men themselves.</p>

<p>He climbed atop a little hillock
and surveyed them carefully, letting
his penetrating gaze pass over each
man in turn. He stood there, his fists
on his hips, with the sunlight gleaming
from his burnished armor, for
nearly a full minute before he
spoke.</p>

<p>Then his powerful voice rang out
over the assembled adventurers.</p>

<p>"My comrades-at-arms! We have
before us a world that is ours for
the taking! It contains more riches
than any man on Earth ever dreamed
existed, and those riches, too, are
ours for the taking. It isn't going to
be a picnic, and we all knew that
when we came. There are dangers
on every side&mdash;from the natives,
from the animals and plants, and
from the climate.</p>

<p>"But there is not one of these that
cannot be overcome by the onslaught
of brave, courageous, and determined
men!</p>

<p>"Ahead of us, we will find the
Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
arrayed against our coming&mdash;Famine,
Pestilence, War, and Death. Each
and all of these we must meet and
conquer as brave men should, for at
their end we will find wealth and
glory!"</p>

<p>A cheer filled the air, startling the
animals in the forest into momentary
silence.</p>

<p>The commander stilled it instantly
with a raised hand.</p>

<p>"Some of you know this country
from our previous expeditions together.
Most of you will find it utterly
strange. And not one of you knows
it as well as I do.</p>

<p>"In order to survive, you must&mdash;and
<i>will</i>&mdash;follow my orders to the
letter&mdash;and beyond.</p>

<p>"First, as to your weapons. We
don't have an unlimited supply of
charges for them, so there will be no
firing of any power weapons unless
absolutely necessary. You have your
swords and your pikes&mdash;use them."</p>

<p>Several of the men unconsciously
gripped the hafts of the long steel
blades at their sides as he spoke the
words, but their eyes never left the
commanding figure on the hummock.</p>

<p>"As for food," he continued,
"we'll live off the land. You'll find
that most of the animals are edible,
but stay away from the plants unless
I give the O.K.</p>

<p>"We have a long way to go, but,
by Heaven, I'm going to get us there
alive! Are you with me?"</p>

<p>A hearty cheer rang from the
throats of the men. They shouted
the commander's name with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"All right!" he bellowed. "There
is one more thing! Anyone who
wants to stay with the ship can do
so; anyone who feels too ill to make
it should consider it his duty to stay
behind, because sick men will simply
hold us up and weaken us more
than if they'd been left behind. Remember,
we're not going to turn
back as a body, and an individual
would never make it alone." He
paused.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>Not a man moved. The commander
grinned&mdash;not with humor, but
with satisfaction. "All right, then:
let's move out."</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V</h2>

<p>Of them all, only a handful, including
the commander, had any real
knowledge of what lay ahead of
them, and that knowledge only pertained
to the periphery of the area
the intrepid band of adventurers
were entering. They knew that the
aliens possessed a rudimentary civilization&mdash;they
did not, at that time,
realize they were entering the outposts
of a powerful barbaric empire&mdash;an
empire almost as well-organized
and well-armed as that of First Century
Rome, and, if anything, even
more savage and ruthless.</p>

<p>It was an empire ruled by a single
family who called themselves the
Great Nobles; at their head was the
Greatest Noble&mdash;the Child of the
Sun Himself. It has since been conjectured
that the Great Nobles were
mutants in the true sense of the
word; a race apart from their subjects.
It is impossible to be absolutely
sure at this late date, and the commander's
expedition, lacking any
qualified geneticists or genetic engineers,
had no way of determining&mdash;and,
indeed, no real <i>interest</i> in determining&mdash;whether
this was or was
not true. None the less, historical
evidence seems to indicate the validity
of the hypothesis.</p>

<p>Never before&mdash;not even in ancient
Egypt&mdash;had the historians ever seen
a culture like it. It was an absolute
monarchy that would have made any
Medieval king except the most
saintly look upon it in awe and
envy. The Russians and the Germans
never even approached it. The Japanese
tried to approximate it at one
time in their history, but they failed.</p>

<p>Secure in the knowledge that theirs
was the only civilizing force on the
face of the planet, the race of the
Great Nobles spread over the length
of a great continent, conquering the
lesser races as they went.</p>

<p>Physically, the Great Nobles and
their lesser subjects were quite similar.
They were, like the commander
and his men, human in every sense
of the word. That this argues some ancient,
prehistoric migration across
the empty gulfs that separate the
worlds cannot be denied, but when
and how that migration took place
are data lost in the mists of time.
However it may have happened, the
fact remains that these people <i>were</i>
human. As someone observed in one
of the reports written up by one of
the officers: "They could pass for Indians,
except their skins are of a
decidedly redder hue."</p>

<p>The race of the Great Nobles held
their conquered subjects in check by
the exercise of two powerful forces:
religion and physical power of arms.
Like the feudal organizations of
Medieval Europe, the Nobles had the
power of life and death over their
subjects, and to a much greater extent
than the European nobles had.
Each family lived on an allotted parcel
of land and did a given job.
Travel was restricted to a radius of
a few miles. There was no money;
there was no necessity for it, since
the government of the Great Nobles
took all produce and portioned it out
again according to need. It was communism
on a vast and&mdash;incomprehensible
as it may seem to the modern
mind&mdash;<i>workable</i> scale. Their
minds were as different from ours
as their bodies were similar; the concept
"freedom" would have been
totally incomprehensible to them.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 156px;">
<img src="images/003.png" width="156" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>They were sun-worshipers, and the
Greatest Noble was the Child of the
Sun, a godling subordinate only to
the Sun Himself. Directly under him
were the lesser Great Nobles, also
Children of the Sun, but to a lesser
extent. They exercised absolute power
over the conquered peoples, but
even they had no concept of freedom,
since they were as tied to the
people as the people were tied to
them. It was a benevolent dictatorship
of a kind never seen before or
since.</p>

<p>At the periphery of the Empire of
the Sun-Child lived still unconquered
savage tribes, which the Imperial
forces were in the process of slowly
taking over. During the centuries,
tribe after tribe had fallen before
the brilliant leadership of the Great
Nobles and the territory of the Empire
had slowly expanded until, at
the time the invading Earthmen
came, it covered almost as much territory
as had the Roman Empire at
its peak.</p>

<p>The Imperial Army, consisting of
upwards of fifty thousand troops,
was extremely mobile in spite of the
handicap of having no form of transportation
except their own legs. They
had no cavalry; the only beast of
burden known to them&mdash;the flame-beasts&mdash;were
too small to carry more
than a hundred pounds, in spite of
their endurance. But the wide,
smooth roads that ran the length and
breadth of the Empire enabled a
marching army to make good time,
and messages carried by runners in
relays could traverse the Empire in
a matter of days, not weeks.</p>

<p>And into this tight-knit, well-organized,
powerful barbaric world
marched Commander Frank with less
than two hundred men and thirty
carriers.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI</h2>

<p>It didn't take long for the men to
begin to chafe under the constant
strain of moving through treacherous
and unfamiliar territory. And the
first signs of chafing made themselves
apparent beneath their armor.</p>

<p>Even the best designed armor cannot
be built to be worn for an unlimited
length of time, and, at first,
the men could see no reason for the
order. They soon found out.</p>

<p>One evening, after camp had been
made, one young officer decided that
he had spent his last night sleeping
in full armor. It was bad enough to
have to march in it, but sleeping in
it was too much. He took it off and
stretched, enjoying the freedom from
the heavy steel. His tent was a long
way from the center of camp, where
a small fire flickered, and the soft
light from the planet's single moon
filtered only dimly through the jungle
foliage overhead. He didn't think
anyone would see him from the commander's
tent.</p>

<p>The commander's orders had been
direct and to the point: "You will
wear your armor at all times; you
will march in it, you will eat in it,
you will sleep in it. During such
times as it is necessary to remove a
part of it, the man doing so will
make sure that he is surrounded by
at least two of his companions in full
armor. There will be no exceptions
to this rule!"</p>

<p>The lieutenant had decided to
make himself an exception.</p>

<p>He turned to step into his tent
when a voice came out of the nearby
darkness.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better get your steel
plates back on before the commander
sees you?"</p>

<p>The young officer turned quickly
to see who had spoken. It was another
of the junior officers.</p>

<p>"Mind your own business," snapped
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The other grinned sardonically.
"And if I don't?"</p>

<p>There had been bad blood between
these two for a long time; it was an
enmity that went back to a time even
before the expedition had begun.
The two men stood there for a long
moment, the light from the distant
fire flickering uncertainly against
their bodies.</p>

<p>The young officer who had removed
his armor had not been foolish
enough to remove his weapons
too; no sane man did that in hostile
territory. His hand went to the haft
of the blade at his side.</p>

<p>"If you say a single word&mdash;"</p>

<p>Instinctively, the other dropped
his hand to his own sword.</p>

<p>"Stop! Both of you!"</p>

<p>And stop they did; no one could
mistake the crackling authority in
that voice. The commander, unseen
in the moving, dim light, had been
circling the periphery of the camp,
to make sure that all was well. He
strode toward the two younger men,
who stood silently, shocked into immobility.
The commander's sword
was already in his hand.</p>

<p>"I'll spit the first man that draws
a blade," he snapped.</p>

<p>His keen eyes took in the situation
at a glance.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant, what are you doing
out of armor?"</p>

<p>"It was hot, sir, and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" The commander's eyes
were dangerous. "An asinine statement
like that isn't even worth listening
to! Get that armor back on!
<i>Move!</i>"</p>

<p>He was standing approximately
between the two men, who had been
four or five yards apart. When the
cowed young officer took a step or
two back toward his tent, the commander
turned toward the other officer.
"And as for you, if&mdash;"</p>

<p>He was cut off by the yell of the
unarmored man, followed by the
sound of his blade singing from its
sheath.</p>

<p>The commander leaped backwards
and spun, his own sword at the
ready, his body settling into a
swordsman's crouch.</p>

<p>But the young officer was not
drawing against his superior. He was
hacking at something ropy and writhing
that squirmed on the ground as
the lieutenant's blade bit into it.
Within seconds, the serpentine thing
gave a convulsive shudder and died.</p>

<p>The lieutenant stepped back
clumsily, his eyes glazing in the flickering
light. "Dropped from th'
tree," he said thickly. "Bit me."</p>

<p>His hand moved to a dark spot
on his chest, but it never reached its
goal. The lieutenant collapsed, crumpling
to the ground.</p>

<p>The commander walked over,
slammed the heel of his heavy boot
hard down on the head of the snaky
thing, crushing it. Then he returned
his blade to its sheath, knelt down by
the young man, and turned him over
on his face.</p>

<p>The commander's own face was
grim.</p>

<p>By this time, some of the nearby
men, attracted by the yell, had come
running. They came to a stop as they
saw the tableau before them.</p>

<p>The commander, kneeling beside
the corpse, looked up at them. With
one hand, he gestured at the body.
"Let this be a lesson to all of you,"
he said in a tight voice. "This man
died because he took off his armor.
That"&mdash;he pointed at the butchered
reptile&mdash;"thing is full of as deadly
a poison as you'll ever see, and it
can move like lightning. <i>But it can't
bite through steel!</i></p>

<p>"Look well at this man and tell
the others what you saw. I don't
want to lose another man in this
idiotic fashion."</p>

<p>He stood up and gestured.</p>

<p>"Bury him."</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII</h2>

<p>They found, as they penetrated
deeper into the savage-infested hinterlands
of the Empire of the Great
Nobles, that the armor fended off
more than just snakes. Hardly a day
passed but one or more of the men
would hear the sharp <i>spang!</i> of a
blowgun-driven dart as it slammed
ineffectually against his armored
back or chest. At first, some of the
men wanted to charge into the surrounding
forest, whence the darts
came, and punish the sniping aliens,
but the commander would have none
of it.</p>

<p>"Stick together," he ordered.
"They'll do worse to us if we're split
up in this jungle. Those blowgun
darts aren't going to hurt you as long
as they're hitting steel. Ignore them
and keep moving."</p>

<p>They kept moving.</p>

<p>Around them, the jungle chattered
and muttered, and, occasionally,
screamed. Clouds of insects, great
and small, hummed and buzzed
through the air. They subsided only
when the drizzling rains came, and
then lifted again from their resting
places when the sun came out to
raise steamy vapors from the moist
ground.</p>

<p>It was not an easy march. Before
many days had passed, the men's
feet were cracked and blistered from
the effects of fungus, dampness, and
constant marching. The compact
military marching order which had
characterized the first few days of
march had long since deteriorated
into a straggling column, where the
weaker were supported by the
stronger.</p>

<p>Three more men died. One simply
dropped in his tracks. He was dead
before anyone could touch him. Insect
bite? Disease? No one knew.</p>

<p>Another had been even less fortunate.
A lionlike carnivore had leaped
on him during the night and clawed
him badly before one of his companions
blasted the thing with a power
weapon. Three days later, the wounded
man was begging to be killed; one
arm and one leg were gangrenous.
But he died while begging, thus
sparing any would-be executioner
from an unpleasant duty.</p>

<p>The third man simply failed to
show up for roll call one morning.
He was never seen again.</p>

<p>But the rest of the column, with
dauntless courage, followed the lead
of their commander.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>It was hard to read their expressions,
those reddened eyes that peered
at him from swollen, bearded
faces. But he knew his own face
looked no different.</p>

<p>"We all knew this wasn't going
to be a fancy-dress ball when we
came," he said. "Nobody said this
was going to be the easiest way in
the world to get rich."</p>

<p>The commander was sitting on
one of the carriers, his eyes watching
the men, who were lined up in front
of him. His voice was purposely
held low, but it carried well.</p>

<p>"The marching has been difficult,
but now we're really going to see
what we're made of.</p>

<p>"We all need a rest, and we all
deserve one. But when I lie down
to rest, I'm going to do it in a
halfway decent bed, with some good,
solid food in my belly.</p>

<p>"Here's the way the picture looks:
An hour's march from here, there's
a good-sized village." He swung partially
away from them and pointed
south. "I think we have earned that
town and everything in it."</p>

<p>He swung back, facing them.
There was a wolfish grin on his face.
"There's gold there, too. Not much,
really, compared with what we'll get
later on, but enough to whet our
appetites."</p>

<p>The men's faces were beginning
to change now, in spite of the swelling.</p>

<p>"I don't think we need worry too
much about the savages that are living
there now. With God on our
side, I hardly see how we can fail."</p>

<p>He went on, telling them how
they would attack the town, the disposition
of men, the use of the carriers,
and so forth. By the time he
was through, every man there was
as eager as he to move in. When he
finished speaking, they set up a
cheer:</p>

<p>"For the Emperor and the Universal
Assembly!"</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>The natives of the small village
had heard that some sort of terrible
beings were approaching through the
jungle. Word had come from the
people of the forest that the strange
monsters were impervious to darts,
and that they had huge dragons with
them which were terrifying even to
look at. They were clad in metal and
made queer noises as they moved.</p>

<p>The village chieftain called his advisers
together to ponder the situation.
What should they do with these
strange things? What were the invaders'
intentions?</p>

<p>Obviously, the things must be
hostile. Therefore, there were only
two courses open&mdash;fight or flee. The
chieftain and his men decided to
fight. It would have been a good
thing if there had only been some
Imperial troops in the vicinity, but
all the troops were farther south,
where a civil war was raging over the
right of succession of the Greatest
Noble.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there were two thousand
fighting men in the village&mdash;well,
two thousand men at any rate,
and they would certainly all fight,
although some were rather young
and a few were too old for any really
hard fighting. On the other hand, it
would probably not come to that,
since the strangers were outnumbered
by at least three to one.</p>

<p>The chieftain gave his orders for
the defense of the village.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>The invading Earthmen approached
the small town cautiously from
the west. The commander had his
men spread out a little, but not so
much that they could be separated.
He saw the aliens grouped around
the square, boxlike buildings, watching
and waiting for trouble.</p>

<p>"We'll give them trouble," the
commander whispered softly. He
waited until his troops were properly
deployed, then he gave the signal
for the charge.</p>

<p>The carriers went in first, thundering
directly into the massed alien
warriors. Each carrier-man fired a
single shot from his power weapon,
and then went to work with his carrier,
running down the terrified
aliens, and swinging a sword with
one hand while he guided with the
other. The commander went in with
that first charge, aiming his own carrier
toward the center of the fray.
He had some raw, untrained men
with him, and he believed in teaching
by example.</p>

<p>The aliens recoiled at the onslaught
of what they took to be horrible living
monsters that were unlike anything
ever seen before.</p>

<p>Then the commander's infantry
charged in. The shock effect of the
carriers had been enough to disorganize
the aliens, but the battle was
not over yet by a long shot.</p>

<p>There were yells from other parts
of the village as some of the other
defenders, hearing the sounds of battle,
came running to reinforce the
home guard. Better than fifteen hundred
men were converging on the
spot.</p>

<p>The invading Earthmen moved in
rapidly against the armed natives,
beating them back by the sheer ferocity
of their attack. Weapons of steel
clashed against weapons of bronze
and wood.</p>

<p>The power weapons were used only
sparingly; only when the necessity
to save a life was greater than the
necessity to conserve weapon charges
was a shot fired.</p>

<p>The commander, from the center
of the fray, took a glance around the
area. One glance was enough.</p>

<p>"They're dropping back!" he
bellowed, his voice carrying well
above the din of the battle, "Keep
'em moving!" He singled out one
of his officers at a distance, and
yelled: "Hernan! Get a couple of
men to cover that street!" He waved
toward one of the narrow streets
that ran off to one side. The others
were already being attended to.</p>

<p>The commander jerked around
swiftly as one of the natives grabbed
hold of the carrier and tried to hack
at the commander with a bronze
sword. The commander spitted him
neatly on his blade and withdrew it
just in time to parry another attack
from the other side.</p>

<p>By this time, the reinforcements
from the other parts of the village
were beginning to come in from
the side streets, but they were a little
late. The warriors in the square&mdash;what
was left of them&mdash;had panicked.
In an effort to get away from the
terrible monsters with their deadly
blades and their fire-spitting weapons,
they were leaving by the same
channels that the reinforcements
were coming in by, and the resultant
jam-up was disastrous. The panic
communicated itself like wildfire,
but no one could move fast enough
to get away from the sweeping, stabbing,
glittering blades of the invading
Earthmen.</p>

<p>"All right," the commander yelled,
"we've got 'em on the run now!
Break up into squads of three and
clear those streets! Clear 'em out!
Keep 'em moving!"</p>

<p>After that, it was the work of minutes
to clear the town.</p>

<p>The commander brought his carrier
to a dead stop, reached out with
his sword, and snagged a bit of cloth
from one of the fallen native warriors.
He began to wipe the blade of
his weapon as Lieutenant commander
Hernan pulled up beside him.</p>

<p>"Casualties?" the commander asked
Hernan without looking up from
his work.</p>

<p>"Six wounded, no dead," said
Hernan. "Or did you want me to
count the aliens, too?"</p>

<p>The commander shook his head.
"No. Get a detail to clear out the
carrion, and then tell Frater Vincent
I want to talk to him. We'll have to
start teaching these people the
Truth."</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII</h2>

<p>"Have you anything to say in your
defense?" the commander asked
coldly.</p>

<p>For a moment, the accused looked
nothing but hatred at the commander,
but there was fear behind that
hatred. At last he found his voice.
"It was mine. You promised us all
a share."</p>

<p>Lieutenant commander Hernan
picked up a leather bag that lay on
the table behind which he and the
commander were sitting. With a
sudden gesture, he upended it, dumping
its contents on the flat, wooden
surface of the table.</p>

<p>"Do you deny that this was found
among your personal possessions?"
he asked harshly.</p>

<p>"No," said the accused soldier.
"Why should I? It's mine. Rightfully
mine. I fought for it. I found it.
I kept it. It's mine." He glanced to
either side, towards the two guards
who flanked him, then looked back
at the commander.</p>

<p>The commander ran an idle finger
through the pound or so of golden
trinkets that Hernan had spilled
from the bag. He knew what the
trooper was thinking. A man had a
right to what he had earned, didn't
he?</p>

<p>The commander picked up one of
the heavier bits of primitive jewelry
and tossed it in his hand. Then he
stood up and looked around the town
square.</p>

<p>The company had occupied the
town for several weeks. The stored
grains in the community warehouse,
plus the relaxation the men had had,
plus the relative security of the town,
had put most of the men back into
condition. One had died from a skin
infection, and another from wounds
sustained in the assault on the town,
but the remainder were in good
health.</p>

<p>And all of them, with the exception
of the sentries guarding the
town's perimeter, were standing in
the square, watching the court-martial.
Their eyes didn't seem to
blink, and their breathing was soft
and measured. They were waiting
for the commander's decision.</p>

<p>The commander, still tossing the
crude golden earring, stood tall and
straight, estimating the feeling of the
men surrounding him.</p>

<p>"Gold," he said finally. "Gold.
That's what we came here for, and
that's what we're going to get. Five
hundred pounds of the stuff would
make any one of you wealthy for the
rest of his life. Do you think I blame
any one of you for wanting it? Do
you think I blame this man here?
Of course not." He laughed&mdash;a
short, hard bark. "Do I blame myself?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 155px;">
<img src="images/004.png" width="155" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>He tossed the bauble again, caught
it. "But wanting it is one thing; getting
it, holding it, and taking care
of it wisely are something else
again.</p>

<p>"I gave orders. I have expected&mdash;and
still expect&mdash;that they will be
obeyed. But I didn't give them just
to hear myself give orders. There
was a reason, and a good one.</p>

<p>"Suppose we let each man take
what gold he could find. What would
happen? The lucky ones would be
wealthy, and the unlucky would still
be poor. And then some of the lucky
ones would wake up some morning
without the gold they'd taken because
someone else had relieved them of it
while they slept.</p>

<p>"And others wouldn't wake up at
all, because they'd be found with
their throats cut.</p>

<p>"I told you to bring every bit of
the metal to me. When this thing
is over, every one of you will get
his share. If a man dies, his share
will be split among the rest, instead
of being stolen by someone else or
lost because it was hidden too well."</p>

<p>He looked at the earring in his
hand, then, with a convulsive sweep
of his arm, he tossed it out into the
middle of the square.</p>

<p>"There! Seven ounces of gold!
Which of you wants it?"</p>

<p>Some of the men eyed the circle
of metal that gleamed brightly on
the sunlit ground, but none of them
made any motion to pick it up.</p>

<p>"So." The commander's voice was
almost gentle. He turned his eyes
back toward the accused. "You know
the orders. You knew them when
you hid this." He gestured negligently
toward the small heap of native-wrought
metal. "Suppose you'd gotten
away with it. You'd have ended
up with your own share, <i>plus</i> this,
thereby cheating the others out of&mdash;"
He glanced at the pile. "Hm-m-m&mdash;say,
twenty-five each. And that's only
a little compared with what we'll get
from now on."</p>

<p>He looked back at the others.
"Unless the shares are taken care of
<i>my</i> way, the largest shares will go
to the dishonest, the most powerful,
and the luckiest. Unless the division
is made as we originally agreed,
we'll end up trying to cut each other's
heart out."</p>

<p>There was hardness in his voice
when he spoke to the accused, but
there was compassion there, too.</p>

<p>"First: You have forfeited your
share in this expedition. All that you
have now, and all that you might
have expected will be divided among
the others according to our original
agreement.</p>

<p>"Second: I do not expect any man
to work for nothing. Since you will
not receive anything from this expedition,
there is no point in your assisting
the rest of us or working
with us in any way whatsoever.</p>

<p>"Third: We can't have anyone
with us who does not carry his own
weight."</p>

<p>He glanced at the guards. "Hang
him." He paused. "Now."</p>

<p>As he was led away, the commander
watched the other men.
There was approval in their eyes,
but there was something else there,
too&mdash;a wariness, a concealed fear.</p>

<p>The condemned man turned suddenly
and began shouting at the commander,
but before he could utter
more than three syllables, a fist
smashed him down. The guards
dragged him off.</p>

<p>"All right, men," said the commander
carefully, "let's search the
village. There might be more gold
about; I have a hunch that this isn't
all he hid. Let's see if we can find
the rest of it." He sensed the relief
of tension as he spoke.</p>

<p>The commander was right. It was
amazing how much gold one man
had been able to stash away.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX</h2>

<p>They couldn't stay long in any one
village; they didn't have the time to
sit and relax any more than was
necessary. Once they had reached the
northern marches of the native empire,
it was to the commander's advantage
to keep his men moving. He
didn't know for sure how good or
how rapid communications were
among the various native provinces,
but he had to assume that they were
top notch, allowing for the limitations
of a barbaric society.</p>

<p>The worst trouble they ran into on
their way was not caused by the native
warriors, but by disease.</p>

<p>The route to the south was spotted
by great strips of sandy barrenness,
torn by winds that swept the grains
of sand into the troopers' eyes and
crept into the chinks of their armor.
Underfoot, the sand made a treacherous
pathway; carriers and men alike
found it heavy going.</p>

<p>The heat from the sun was intense;
the brilliant beams from the
primary seemed to penetrate through
the men's armor and through the insulation
underneath, and made the
marching even harder.</p>

<p>Even so, in spite of the discomfort,
the men were making good
time until the disease struck. And
that stopped them in their tracks.</p>

<p>What the disease was or how it
was spread is unknown and unknowable
at this late date. Virus or bacterium,
amoeba or fungus&mdash;whatever
it was, it struck.</p>

<p>Symptoms: Lassitude, weariness,
weakness, and pain.</p>

<p>Signs: Great, ulcerous, wartlike,
blood-filled blisters that grew rapidly
over the body.</p>

<p>A man might go to sleep at night
feeling reasonably tired, but not ill,
and wake up in the morning to find
himself unable to rise, his muscles
too weak to lift him from his bed.</p>

<p>If the blisters broke, or were
lanced, it was almost impossible to
stop the bleeding, and many died,
not from the toxic effect of the disease
itself, but from simple loss of
blood.</p>

<p>But, like many epidemics, the
thing had a fairly short life span.
After two weeks, it had burned itself
out. Most of those who got it recovered,
and a few were evidently
immune.</p>

<p>Eighteen men remained behind
in shallow graves.</p>

<p>The rest went on.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X</h2>

<p>No man is perfect. Even with four
decades of training behind him,
Commander Frank couldn't call the
turn every time. After the first few
villages, there were no further battles.
The natives, having seen what
the invaders could do, simply showed
up missing when the commander
and his men arrived. The villages
were empty by the time the column
reached the outskirts.</p>

<p>Frater Vincent, the agent of the
Universal Assembly, complained in
no uncertain terms about this state
of affairs.</p>

<p>"As you know, commander," he
said frowningly one morning, "it's
no use trying to indoctrinate a people
we can't contact. And you can't
subject a people by force of arms
alone; the power of the Truth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know, Frater," the commander
interposed quickly. "But we can't
deal with these savages in the hinterlands.
When we get a little farther
into this barbarian empire, we can
take the necessary steps to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Truth," Frater Vincent interrupted
somewhat testily, "is for all
men. It works, regardless of the state
of civilization of the society."</p>

<p>The commander looked out of the
unglazed window of the native hut
in which he had established his temporary
headquarters, in one of the
many villages he had taken&mdash;or,
rather, walked into without a fight
because it was empty. "But you'll
admit, Frater, that it takes longer
with savages."</p>

<p>"True," said Frater Vincent.</p>

<p>"We simply haven't the time.
We've got to keep on the move.
And, besides, we haven't even been
able to contact any of the natives for
quite a while; they get out of our
way. And we have taken a few prisoners&mdash;"
His voice was apologetic,
but there was a trace of irritation in
it. He didn't want to offend Frater
Vincent, of course, but dammit, the
Assemblyman didn't understand military
tactics at all. Or, he corrected
himself hastily, at least only slightly.</p>

<p>"Yes," admitted Frater Vincent,
"and I've had considerable success
with the prisoners. But, remember&mdash;we're
not here just to indoctrinate a
few occasional prisoners, but to
change the entire moral and philosophical
viewpoint of an entire race."</p>

<p>"I realize that, Frater," the commander
admitted. He turned from
the window and faced the Assemblyman.
"We're getting close to the
Great Bay now. That's where our
ship landed on the second probing
expedition. I expect we'll be more
welcome there than we have been,
out here in the countryside. We'll
take it easy, and I think you'll have
a chance to work with the natives
on a mass basis."</p>

<p>The Frater smiled. "Excellent,
commander. I ... uh ... want you
to understand that I'm not trying to
tell you your business; you run this
campaign as you see fit. But don't
lose sight of the ultimate goal of
life."</p>

<p>"I won't. How could I? It's just
that my methods are not, perhaps,
as refined as yours."</p>

<p>Frater Vincent nodded, still smiling.
"True. You are a great deal
more direct. And&mdash;in your own way&mdash;just
as effective. After all, the Assembly
could not function without
the military, but there were armies
long before the Universal Assembly
came into being."</p>

<p>The commander smiled back.
"Not any armies like this, Frater."</p>

<p>Frater Vincent nodded. The understanding
between the two men&mdash;at
least on that point&mdash;was tacit and
mutual. He traced a symbol in the
air and left the commander to his
thoughts.</p>

<p>Mentally, the commander went
through the symbol-patterns that he
had learned as a child&mdash;the symbol-patterns
that brought him into direct
contact with the Ultimate Power, the
Power that controlled not only the
spinning of atoms and the whirling
of electrons in their orbits, but the
workings of probability itself.</p>

<p>Once indoctrinated into the teachings
of the Universal Assembly, any
man could tap that Power to a greater
or lesser degree, depending on his
mental control and ethical attitude.
At the top level, a first-class adept
could utilize that Power for telepathy,
psychokinesis, levitation, teleportation,
and other powers that the commander
only vaguely understood.</p>

<p>He, himself, had no such depth of
mind, such iron control over his will,
and he knew he'd never have it. But
he could and did tap that Power to
the extent that his physical body was
under near-perfect control at all
times, and not even the fear of death
could shake his determination to win
or his great courage.</p>

<p>He turned again to the window
and looked at the alien sky. There
was a great deal yet to be done.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>The commander needed information&mdash;needed
it badly. He had to
know what the government of the
alien empire was doing. Had they
been warned of his arrival? Surely
they must have, and yet they had
taken no steps to impede his progress.</p>

<p>For this purpose, he decided to
set up headquarters on an island just
offshore in the Great Bay. It was a
protected position, easily defended
from assault, and the natives, he
knew from his previous visit, were
friendly.</p>

<p>They even helped him to get his
men and equipment and the carriers
across on huge rafts.</p>

<p>From that point, he began collecting
the information he needed to invade
the central domains of the
Greatest Noble himself. It seemed an
ideal spot&mdash;not only protection-wise,
but because this was the spot he had
originally picked for the landing of
the ship. The vessel, which had returned
to the base for reinforcements
and extra supplies, would be aiming
for the Great Bay area when she
came back. And there was little likelihood
that atmospheric disturbances
would throw her off course again;
Captain Bartholomew was too good
a man to be fooled twice.</p>

<p>But landing on that island was the
first&mdash;and only&mdash;mistake the commander
made during the campaign.
The rumors of internal bickerings
among the Great Nobles of the barbarian
empire were not the only rumors
he heard. News of more local
treachery came to his ears through
the agency of natives, now loyal to
the commander, who had been indoctrinated
into the philosophy of
the Assembly.</p>

<p>A group of native chieftains had
decided that the invading Earthmen
were too dangerous to be allowed
to remain on their island, in spite of
the fact that the invaders had done
them no harm. There were, after all,
whisperings from the north, whence
the invaders had come, that the armored
beings with the terrible weapons
had used their power more than
once during their march to the south.
The chieftains were determined to
rid their island of the potential
menace.</p>

<p>As soon as the matter was brought
to the commander's attention, he
acted. He sent out a patrol to the
place where the ringleaders were
meeting, arrested them, and sentenced
them to death. He didn't realize
what effect that action would
have on the rest of the islanders.</p>

<p>He almost found out too late.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="XI" id="XI"></a>XI</h2>

<p>"There must be three thousand of
them out there," said Lieutenant
commander Hernan tightly, "and
every one of them's crazy."</p>

<p>"Rot!" The commander spat on
the ground and then sighted again
along the barrel of his weapon. "I'm
the one who's crazy. I'm a lousy
politician; that's my trouble."</p>

<p>The lieutenant commander shrugged
lightly. "Anyone can make a
mistake. Just chalk it up to experience."</p>

<p>"I will, when we get out of this
mess." He watched the gathering
natives through hard, slitted eyes.</p>

<p>The invading Earthmen were in a
village at the southern end of the
eight-mile-long island, waiting inside
the mud-brick huts while the
natives who had surrounded the village
worked themselves into a frenzy
for an attack. The commander knew
there was no sense in charging into
them at that point: they would simply
scatter and reassemble. The only
thing to do was wait until they attacked&mdash;and
then smash the attack.</p>

<p>"Hernan," he said, his eyes still
watching the outside, "you and the
others get out there with the carriers
after the first volley. Cut them down.
They're twenty-to-one against us, so
make every blow count. Move."</p>

<p>Hernan nodded wordlessly and
slipped away.</p>

<p>The natives were building up their
courage with some sort of war dance,
whooping and screaming and making
threatening gestures toward the
embattled invaders. Then the pattern
of the dance changed; the islanders
whirled to face the mud-brick buildings
which housed the invading
Earthmen. Suddenly, the dance
broke, and the warriors ran in a
screaming charge, straight for the
trapped soldiers.</p>

<p>The commander waited. His own
shot would be the signal, and he
didn't want the men to fire too
quickly. If the islanders were hit too
soon, they might fall back into the
woods and set up a siege, which the
little company couldn't stand. Better
to mop up the natives now, if possible.</p>

<p>Closer. Closer&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Now!</i></p>

<p>The commander's first shot picked
off one of the leaders in the front
ranks of the native warriors, and was
followed by a raking volley from the
other power weapons, firing from
the windows of the mud-brick buildings.
The warriors in the front rank
dropped, and those in the second
rank had to move adroitly to keep
from stumbling over the bodies of
their fallen fellows. The firing from
the huts became ragged, but its raking
effect was still deadly. A cloud
of heavy, stinking smoke rolled
across the clearing between the edge
of the jungle and the village, as the
bright, hard lances of heat leaped
from the muzzles of the power weapons
toward the bodies of the charging
warriors.</p>

<p>The charge was gone from the
commander's weapon, and he didn't
bother to replace it. As Hernan and
his men charged into the melee with
their carriers, the commander went
with them.</p>

<p>At the same time, the armored
infantrymen came pouring out of the
mud-brick houses, swinging their
swords, straight into the mass of confused
native warriors. A picked
group of sharpshooters remained
behind, in the concealment of the
huts to pick off the warriors at the
edge of the battle with their sporadic
fire.</p>

<p>The commander's lips were moving
a little as he formed the symbol-patterns
of power almost unconsciously;
a lifetime of habit had
burned them into his brain so deeply
that he could form them automatically
while turning the thinking part
of his mind to the business at
hand.</p>

<p>He soon found himself entirely
surrounded by the alien warriors.
Their bronze weapons glittered in
the sunlight as they tried to fight off
the onslaught of the invaders. And
those same bronze weapons were
sheared, nicked, blunted, bent, and
broken as they met the harder steel
of the commander's sword.</p>

<p>Then the unexpected happened.
One of the warriors, braver than the
rest, made a grab for the commander's
sword arm. At almost the same
moment, a warrior on the other side
of the carrier aimed a spear thrust
at his side.</p>

<p>Either by itself would have been
ineffectual. The spear clanged harmlessly
from the commander's armor,
and the warrior who had attempted
to pull him from the carrier died
before he could give much of a tug.
But the combination, plus the fact
that the heavy armor was a little unwieldy,
overbalanced him. He toppled
to the ground with a clash of
steel as he and the carrier parted
company.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/005.png" width="600" height="399" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Without a human hand at its controls,
the carrier automatically moved
away from the mass of struggling
fighters and came to a halt well away
from the battle.</p>

<p>The commander rolled as he hit
and leaped to his feet, his sword
moving in flickering arcs around
him. The natives had no knowledge
of effective swordplay. Like any barbarian,
they conceived of a sword as
a cutting instrument rather than a
thrusting one. They chopped with
them, using small shields to protect
their bodies as they tried to hack the
commander to bits.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>But the commander had no desire
to become mincemeat just yet. Five
of the barbarians were coming at
him, their swords raised for a downward
slash. The commander lunged
forward with a straight stop-thrust
aimed at the groin of the nearest
one. It came as a complete surprise
to the warrior, who doubled up in
pain.</p>

<p>The commander had already withdrawn
his blade and was attacking
the second as the first fell. He made
another feint to the groin and then
changed the aim of his point as the
warrior tried to cover with his shield.
A buckler is fine protection against
a man who is trying to hack you to
death with a chopper, because a
heavy cutting sword and a shield
have about the same inertia, and thus
the same maneuverability. But the
shield isn't worth anything against a
light stabbing weapon. The warrior's
shield started downward and he was
unable to stop it and reverse its direction
before the commander's
sword pierced his throat.</p>

<p>Two down, three to go. No, four.
Another warrior had decided to join
the little battle against the leader
of the invading Earthmen.</p>

<p>The commander changed his tactics
just slightly with the third man.
He slashed with the tip of his blade
against the descending sword-arm of
his opponent&mdash;a short, quick flick of
his wrist that sheared through the inside
of the wrist, severing tendons,
muscles, veins and arteries as it cut
to the bone. The sword clanged
harmlessly off the commander's
shoulder. A quick thrust, and the
third man died.</p>

<p>The other three slowed their attack
and began circling warily, trying
to get behind the commander. Instead
of waiting, he charged forward,
again cutting at the sword arm
of his adversary, severing fingers
this time. As the warrior turned, the
commander's sword pierced his
side.</p>

<p>How long it went on, he had no
idea. He kept his legs and his sword-arm
moving, and his eyes ever alert
for new foes as man after man dropped
beneath that snake-tonguing
blade. Inside his armor, perspiration
poured in rivulets down his skin,
and his arms and legs began to ache,
but not for one second did he let
up. He could not see what was going
on, could not tell the direction of the
battle nor even allow his mind to
wonder what was going on more
than ten paces from him.</p>

<p>And then, quite suddenly, it seemed,
it was all over. Lieutenant commander
Hernan and five other men
pulled up with their carriers, as if
from nowhere, their weapons dealing
death, clearing a space around
their commander.</p>

<p>"You hurt?" bawled Hernan.</p>

<p>The commander paused to catch
his breath. He knew there was a
sword-slash across his face, and his
right leg felt as though there was a
cut on it, but otherwise&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm all right," he said. "How's
it going?"</p>

<p>"They're breaking," Hernan told
him. "We'll have them scattered
within minutes."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, the surge of
battle moved away from them, toward
the forest. The charge of the
carriers, wreaking havoc on every
side, had broken up the battle formation
the aliens had had; the flaming
death from the horrible weapons of
the invaders, the fearless courage of
the foot soldiers, and the steel-clad
monsters that were running amuck
among them shattered the little discipline
they had. Panicky, they lost
their anger, which had taken them
several hours to build up. They scattered,
heading for the forest.</p>

<p>Shortly, the village was silent. Not
an alien warrior was to be seen, save
for the hundreds of mute corpses that
testified to the carnage that had been
wrought.</p>

<p>Several of the commander's men
had been wounded, and three had
died. Lieutenant commander Hernan
had been severely wounded in the
leg by a native javelin, but the injury
was a long way from being fatal.</p>

<p>Hernan gritted his teeth while his
leg was being bandaged. "The angels
were with us on that one," he said
between winces.</p>

<p>The commander nodded. "I hope
they stick with us. We'll need 'em
to get off this island."</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII</h2>

<p>For a while, it looked as though
they were trapped on the island. The
natives didn't dare to attack again,
but no hunting party was safe, and
the food supply was dropping. They
had gotten on the island only by the
help of the natives, who had ferried
them over on rafts. But getting off
was another thing, now that the natives
were hostile. Cutting down
trees to build rafts might possibly be
managed, but during the loading the
little company would be too vulnerable
to attack.</p>

<p>The commander was seated bleakly
in the hut he had taken as his
headquarters, trying to devise a
scheme for getting to the mainland,
when the deadlock was finally broken.</p>

<p>There was a flurry of footsteps
outside, a thump of heavy boots as
one of the younger officers burst into
the room.</p>

<p>"Commander!" he yelled. "Commander!
Come outside!"</p>

<p>The commander leaped to his feet.
"Another attack?"</p>

<p>"No, sir! Come look!"</p>

<p>The commander strode quickly to
the door. His sight followed the line
of the young officer's pointing finger.</p>

<p>There, outlined against the blue
of the sky, was a ship!</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>The news from home was encouraging,
but it was a long way from
being what the commander wanted.
Another hundred men and more
carriers had been added to the original
company of now hardened veterans,
and the recruits, plus the protection
of the ship's guns, were
enough to enable the entire party to
leave the island for the mainland.</p>

<p>By this time, the commander had
gleaned enough information from
the natives to be able to plan the next
step in his campaign. The present
Greatest Noble, having successfully
usurped the throne from his predecessor,
was still not in absolute control
of the country. He had won a
civil war, but his rule was still too
shaky to allow him to split up his
armies, which accounted for the fact
that, thus far, no action had been
taken by the Imperial troops against
the invading Earthmen.</p>

<p>The commander set up a base on
the mainland, near the coast, left a
portion of his men there to defend
it, and, with the remainder, marched
inland to come to grips with the
Greatest Noble himself.</p>

<p>As they moved in toward the heart
of the barbarian empire, the men
noticed a definite change in the degree
of civilization of the natives&mdash;or,
at least, in the degree of technological
advancement. There were
large towns, not small villages, to be
dealt with, and there were highways
and bridges that showed a knowledge
of engineering equivalent to that of
ancient Rome.</p>

<p>The engineers of the Empire of
the Great Nobles were a long way
above the primitive. They could
have, had they had any reason to,
erected a pyramid the equal of great
Khufu's in size, and probably even
more neatly constructed. Militarily
speaking, the lack of knowledge of
iron hampered them, but it must be
kept in mind that a well-disciplined
and reasonably large army, armed
with bronze-tipped spears, bronze
swords, axes, and maces, can make
a formidable foe, even against a
much better equipped group.</p>

<p>The Imperial armies were much
better disciplined and much better
armed than any of the natives the
commander had thus far dealt with,
and there were reputed to be more
than ten thousand of them with the
Greatest Noble in his mountain
stronghold. Such considerations
prompted the commander to plan
his strategy carefully, but they did
not deter him in the least. If he had
been able to bring aircraft and perhaps
a thermonuclear bomb or two
for demonstration purposes, the attack
might have been less risky, but
neither had been available to a man
of his limited means, so he had to
work without them.</p>

<p>But now, he avoided fighting if
at all possible. Working with Frater
Vincent, the commander worked to
convince the natives on the fertile
farms and in the prosperous villages
that he and his company were merely
ambassadors of good will&mdash;missionaries
and traders. He and his
men had come in peace, and if they
were received in peace, well and
good. If not ... well, they still had
their weapons.</p>

<p>The commander was depending
on the vagueness of the information
that may have filtered down from the
north. The news had already come
that the invaders were fierce and
powerful fighters, but the commander
gave the impression that the only
reason any battles had taken place
was because the northern tribes had
been truculent in the extreme. He
succeeded fairly well; the natives he
now met considered their brethren
of the northern provinces to be little
better than savages, and therefore to
be expected to treat strangers inhospitably
and bring about their own
ruin. The southern citizens of the
empire eyed the strangers with apprehension,
but they offered very
little resistance. The commander and
his men were welcomed warily at
each town, and, when they left, were
bid farewell with great relief.</p>

<p>It took a little time for the commander
to locate the exact spot where
the Greatest Noble and his retinue
were encamped. The real capital of
the empire was located even farther
south, but the Greatest Noble was
staying, for the nonce, in a city
nestled high in the mountains, well
inland from the seacoast. The commander
headed for the mountains.</p>

<p>The passage into the mountains
wasn't easy. The passes were narrow
and dangerous, and the weather was
cold. The air became thinner at every
step. At eight thousand feet, mountain
climbing in heavy armor becomes
more than just hard work, and
at twelve thousand it becomes exhausting
torture. But the little company
went on, sparked, fueled, and
driven by the personal force of their
commander, who stayed in the vanguard,
his eyes ever alert for treachery
from the surrounding mountains.</p>

<p>When the surprise came, it was of
an entirely different kind than he
had expected. The commander's carrier
came over a little rise, and he
brought it to an abrupt halt as he
saw the valley spread out beneath
him. He left the carrier, walked over
to a boulder near the edge of the
cliff, and looked down at the valley.</p>

<p>It was an elongated oval of verdant
green, fifteen miles long by
four wide, looking like an emerald
set in the rocky granite of the surrounding
peaks that thrust upward
toward the sky. The valley ran
roughly north-and-south, and to his
right, at the southern end, the commander
could see a city, although it
was impossible to see anyone moving
in it at this distance.</p>

<p>To his left, he could see great
clouds of billowing vapor that rolled
across the grassy plain&mdash;evidently
steam from the volcanic hot springs
which he had been told were to be
found in this valley.</p>

<p>But, for the moment, it was neither
the springs nor the city that interested
him most.</p>

<p>In the heart of the valley, spreading
over acre after acre, were the
tents and pavilions of a mighty army
encampment. From the looks of it,
the estimate of thirty thousand troops
which had been given him by various
officials along the way was, if
anything, too small.</p>

<p>It was a moment that might have
made an ordinary man stop to think,
and, having thought, to turn and go.
But the commander was no ordinary
man, and the sheer remorseless courage
that had brought him this far
wouldn't allow him to turn back. So
far, he had kept the Greatest Noble
off balance with his advancing tactics;
if he started to retreat, the Greatest
Noble would realize that the invaders
were not invincible, and
would himself advance to crush the
small band of strangers.</p>

<p>The Greatest Noble had known
the commander and his men were
coming; he was simply waiting, to
find out what they were up to, confident
that he could dispose of them
at his leisure. The commander knew
that, and he knew he couldn't retreat
now. There was no decision to be
made, really&mdash;only planning to be
done.</p>

<p>He turned back from the boulder
to face the officers who had come to
take a look at the valley.</p>

<p>"We'll go to the city first," he
said.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="XIII" id="XIII"></a>XIII</h2>

<p>The heavy tread of the invaders'
boots as they entered the central
plaza of the walled city awakened
nothing but echoes from the stone
walls that surrounded the plaza. Like
the small villages they had entered
farther north, the city seemed devoid
of life.</p>

<p>There is nothing quite so depressing
and threatening as a deserted
city. The windows in the walls of
the buildings seemed like blank,
darkened eyes that watched&mdash;and
waited. Nothing moved, nothing
made a sound, except the troopers
themselves.</p>

<p>The men kept close to the walls;
there was no point in bunching up
in the middle of the square to be cut
down by arrows from the windows
of the upper floors.</p>

<p>The commander ordered four
squads of men to search the buildings
and smoke out anyone who was
there, but they turned up nothing.
The entire city was empty. And there
were no traps, no ambushes&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>The commander, with Lieutenant
commander Hernan and another officer,
climbed to the top of the central
building of the town. In the distance,
several miles away, they could see
the encampment of the monarch's
troops.</p>

<p>"The only thing we can do," the
commander said, his face hard and
determined, "is to call their bluff.
You two take about three dozen men
and go out there with the carriers
and give them a show. Go right into
camp, as if you owned the place.
Throw a scare into them, but don't
hurt anyone. Then, very politely, tell
the Emperor, or whatever he calls
himself, that I would like him to
come here for dinner and a little
talk."</p>

<p>The two officers looked at each
other, then at the commander.</p>

<p>"Just like that?" asked Hernan.</p>

<p>"Just like that," said the commander.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>The demonstration and exhibition
went well&mdash;as far as it had gone.
The native warriors had evidently
been quite impressed by the onslaught
of the terrifying monsters
that had thundered across the plain
toward them, right into the great
camp, and come to a dead halt directly
in front of the magnificent
pavilion of the Greatest Noble himself.</p>

<p>The Greatest Noble put up a good
face. He had obviously been expecting
the visitors, because he and his
lesser nobles were lined up before
the pavilion, the Greatest Noble ensconced
on a sort of portable throne.
He managed to look perfectly calm
and somewhat bored by the whole
affair, and didn't seem to be particularly
effected at all when Lieutenant
commander Hernan bowed low before
him and requested his presence
in the city.</p>

<p>And the Greatest Noble's answer
was simple and to the point, although
it was delivered by one of his
courtiers.</p>

<p>"You may tell your commander,"
said the noble, "that His Effulgence
must attend to certain religious
duties tonight, since he is also High
Priest of the Sun. However, His
Effulgence will most graciously deign
to speak to your commander tomorrow.
In the meantime, you are requested
to enjoy His Effulgence's
gracious hospitality in the city, which
has been emptied for your convenience.
It is yours, for the nonce."</p>

<p>Which left nothing for the two
officers and their men to do but go
thundering back across the plain to
the city.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>The Greatest Noble did not bring
his whole army with him, but the
pageant of barbaric splendor that
came tootling and drumming its way
into the city the next evening was a
magnificent sight. His Effulgence
himself was dressed in a scarlet robe
and a scarlet, turbanlike head covering
with scarlet fringes all around it.
About his throat was a necklace of
emerald-green gems, and his clothing
was studded with more of them.
Gold gleamed everywhere. He was
borne on an ornate, gilded palanquin,
carried high above the crowd
on the shoulders of a dozen stalwart
nobles, only slightly less gorgeously-dressed
than the Greatest Noble. The
nobility that followed was scarcely
less showy in its finery.</p>

<p>When they came into the plaza,
however, the members of the procession
came to a halt. The singing and
music died away.</p>

<p>The plaza was absolutely empty.</p>

<p>No one had come out to greet the
Emperor.</p>

<p>There were six thousand natives
in the plaza, and not a sign of the
invaders.</p>

<p>The commander, hiding well back
in the shadows in one of the rooms
of the central building, watched
through the window and noted the
evident consternation of the royal
entourage with satisfaction. Frater
Vincent, standing beside him, whispered,
"Well?"</p>

<p>"All right," the commander said
softly, "they've had a taste of what
we got when we came in. I suppose
they've had enough. Let's go out
and act like hosts."</p>

<p>The commander and a squad of
ten men, along with Frater Vincent,
strode majestically out of the door
of the building and walked toward
the Greatest Noble. They had all
polished their armor until it shone,
which was about all they could do
in the way of finery, but they evidently
looked quite impressive in the
eyes of the natives.</p>

<p>"Greetings, Your Effulgence,"
said the commander, giving the
Greatest Noble a bow that was hardly
five degrees from the perpendicular.
"I trust we find you well."</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>In the buildings surrounding the
square, hardly daring to move for
fear the clank of metal on metal
might give the whole plan away, the
remaining members of the company
watched the conversation between
their commander and the Greatest
Noble. They couldn't hear what was
being said, but that didn't matter;
they knew what to do as soon as the
commander gave the signal. Every
eye was riveted on the commander's
right hand.</p>

<p>It seemed an eternity before the
commander casually reached up to
his helmet and brushed a hand across
it&mdash;once&mdash;twice&mdash;three times.</p>

<p>Then all hell broke loose. The air
was split by the sound of power
weapons throwing their lances of
flame into the massed ranks of the
native warriors. The gunners, safe
behind the walls of the buildings,
poured a steady stream of accurately
directed fire into the packed mob,
while the rest of the men charged in
with their blades, thrusting and
slashing as they went.</p>

<p>The aliens, panic-stricken by the
sudden, terrifying assault, tried to
run, but there was nowhere to run
to. Every exit had been cut off to
bottle up the Imperial cortege. Within
minutes, the entrances to the
square were choked with the bodies
of those who tried to flee.</p>

<p>As soon as the firing began, the
commander and his men began to
make their way toward the Greatest
Noble. They had been forced to
stand a good five yards away during
the parlay, cut off from direct contact
by the Imperial guards. The
commander, sword in hand, began
cutting his way through to the
palanquin.</p>

<p>The palanquin bearers seemed
frozen; they couldn't run, they
couldn't fight, and they didn't dare
drop their precious cargo.</p>

<p>The commander's voice bellowed
out over the carnage. "Take him
prisoner! I'll personally strangle the
idiot who harms him!" And then he
was too busy to yell.</p>

<p>Two members of the Greatest
Noble's personal guard came for
him, swords out, determined to give
their lives, if necessary, to preserve
the sacred life of their monarch. And
give them they did.</p>

<p>The commander's blade lashed out
once, sliding between the ribs of the
first guard. He toppled and almost
took the sword with him, but the
commander wrenched it free in time
to parry the downward slash of the
second guard's bronze sword. It was
a narrow thing, because the bronze
sword, though of softer stuff than the
commander's steel, was also heavier,
and thus hard to deflect. As it sang
past him, the commander swung a
chop at the man's neck, cutting it
halfway through. He stepped quickly
to one side to avoid the falling body
and thrust his blade through a third
man, who was aiming a blow at the
neck of one of the commander's
officers. There were only a dozen feet
separating the commander from his
objective, the palanquin of the Greatest
Noble, but he had to wade
through blood to get there.</p>

<p>The palanquin itself was no longer
steady. Three of the twelve nobles
who had been holding it had already
fallen, and there were two of the
commander's men already close
enough to touch the royal person, but
they were too busy fighting to make
any attempt to grab him. The Greatest
Noble, unarmed, could only
huddle in his seat, terrified, but it
would take more than two men to
snatch him from his bodyguard. The
commander fought his way in closer.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 153px;">
<img src="images/006.png" width="153" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>Two more of the palanquin bearers
went down, and the palanquin
itself began to topple. The Greatest
Noble screamed as he fell toward
the commander.</p>

<p>One of the commander's men spun
around as he heard the scream so
close to him, and, thinking that the
Greatest Noble was attacking his
commander, lunged out with his
blade.</p>

<p>It was almost a disaster. Moving
quickly, the commander threw out
his left arm to deflect the sword. He
succeeded, but he got a bad slash
across his hand for his trouble.</p>

<p>He yelled angrily at the surprised
soldier, not caring what he said.
Meanwhile, the others of the squad,
seeing that the Greatest Noble had
fallen, hurried to surround him. Two
minutes later, the Greatest Noble
was a prisoner, being half carried,
half led into the central building by
four of the men, while the remaining
six fought a rear-guard action to
hold off the native warriors who
were trying to rescue the sacred person
of the Child of the Sun.</p>

<p>Once inside, the Greatest Noble
was held fast while the doors were
swung shut.</p>

<p>Outside, the slaughter went on.
All the resistance seemed to go out
of the warriors when they saw their
sacred monarch dragged away by the
invading Earthmen. It was every
man for himself and the Devil take
the hindmost. And the Devil, in the
form of the commander's troops,
certainly did.</p>

<p>Within half an hour after it had
begun, the butchery was over. More
than three thousand of the natives
had died, and an unknown number
more badly wounded. Those who
had managed to get out and get away
from the city kept on going. They
told the troops who had been left
outside what had happened, and a
mass exodus from the valley began.</p>

<p>Safely within the fortifications of
the central building, the commander
allowed himself one of his rare grins
of satisfaction. Not a single one of
his own men had been killed, and
the only wound which had been sustained
by anyone in the company
was the cut on his own hand. Still
smiling, he went into the room
where the Greatest Noble, dazed and
shaken, was being held by two of
the commander's men. The commander
bowed&mdash;this time, very low.</p>

<p>"I believe, Your Effulgence, that
we have an appointment for dinner.
Come, the banquet has been laid."</p>

<p>And, as though he were still playing
the gracious host, the commander
led the half-paralyzed Child of the
Sun to the room where the banquet
had been put on a table in perfect
diplomatic array.</p>

<p>"Your Effulgence may sit at my
right hand," said the commander
pleasantly.</p>

<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV</h2>

<p>As MacDonald said of Robert
Wilson, "This is not an account of
how Boosterism came to Arcadia."
It's a devil of a long way from it.
And once the high point of a story
has been reached and passed, it is
pointless to prolong it too much.
The capture of the Greatest Noble
broke the power of the Empire of
the Great Nobles forever. The loyal
subjects were helpless without a leader,
and the disloyal ones, near the
periphery of the Empire, didn't care.
The crack Imperial troops simply
folded up and went home. The
Greatest Noble went on issuing orders,
and they were obeyed; the people
were too used to taking orders
from authority to care whether they
were really the Greatest Noble's own
idea or not.</p>

<p>In a matter of months, two hundred
men had conquered an empire,
with a loss of thirty-five or forty
men. Eventually, they had to execute
the old Greatest Noble and put his
more tractable nephew on the throne,
but that was a mere incident.</p>

<p>Gold? It flowed as though there
were an endless supply. The commander
shipped enough back on the
first load to make them all wealthy.</p>

<p>The commander didn't go back
home to spend his wealth amid the
luxuries of the Imperial court, even
though Emperor Carl appointed him
to the nobility. That sort of thing
wasn't the commander's meat. There,
he would be a fourth-rate noble;
here, he was the Imperial Viceroy,
responsible only to the distant Emperor.
There, he would be nothing;
here, he was almost a king.</p>

<p>Two years after the capture of the
Greatest Noble, he established a new
capital on the coast and named it
Kingston. And from Kingston he
ruled with an iron hand.</p>

<p>As has been intimated, this was
<i>not</i> Arcadia. A year after the founding
of Kingston, the old capital was
attacked, burned, and almost fell under
siege, due to a sudden uprising
of the natives under the new Greatest
Noble, who had managed to escape.
But the uprising collapsed because
of the approach of the planting
season; the warriors had to go back
home and plant their crops or the
whole of the agriculture-based country
would starve&mdash;except the invading
Earthmen.</p>

<p>Except in a few instances, the natives
were never again any trouble.</p>

<p>But the commander&mdash;now the
Viceroy&mdash;had not seen the end of
his troubles.</p>

<p>He had known his limitations, and
realized that the governing of a
whole planet&mdash;or even one continent&mdash;was
too much for one man when
the population consists primarily of
barbarians and savages. So he had
delegated the rule of a vast area to
the south to another&mdash;a Lieutenant
commander James, known as "One-Eye,"
a man who had helped finance
the original expedition, and had arrived
after the conquest.</p>

<p>One-Eye went south and made
very small headway against the more
barbaric tribes there. He did not become
rich, and he did not achieve
anywhere near the success that the
Viceroy had. So he came back north
with his army and decided to unseat
the Viceroy and take his place.
That was five years after the capture
of the Greatest Noble.</p>

<p>One-Eye took Center City, the old
capital, and started to work his way
northward, toward Kingston. The
Viceroy's forces met him at a place
known as Salt Flats and thoroughly
trounced him. He was captured, tried
for high treason, and executed.</p>

<p>One would think that the execution
ended the threat of Lieutenant
commander James, but not so. He
had a son, and he had had followers.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV</h2>

<p>Nine years. Nine years since the
breaking of a vast empire. It really
didn't seem like it. The Viceroy
looked at his hands. They were veined
and thin, and the callouses were
gone. Was he getting soft, or just
getting old? A little bit&mdash;no, a <i>great
deal</i> of both.</p>

<p>He sat in his study, in the Viceregal
Palace at Kingston, chewing over
the events of the past weeks. Twice,
rumors had come that he was to be
assassinated. He and two of his
councilors had been hanged in effigy
in the public square not long back.
He had been snubbed publicly by
some of the lesser nobles.</p>

<p>Had he ruled harshly, or was it
just jealousy? And was it, really, as
some said, caused by the Southerners
and the followers of Young Jim?</p>

<p>He didn't know. And sometimes,
it seemed as if it didn't matter.</p>

<p>Here he was, sitting alone in his
study, when he should have gone to
a public function. And he had stayed
because of fear of assassination.</p>

<p>Was it&mdash;</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door.</p>

<p>"Come in."</p>

<p>A servant entered. "Sir Martin is
here, my lord."</p>

<p>The Viceroy got to his feet.
"Show him in, by all means."</p>

<p>Sir Martin, just behind the servant,
stepped in, smiling, and the Viceroy
returned his smile. "Well, everything
went off well enough without
you," said Sir Martin.</p>

<p>"Any sign of trouble?"</p>

<p>"None, my lord; none whatsoever.
The&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Damn!" the Viceroy interrupted
savagely. "I should have known!
What have I done but display my
cowardice? I'm getting yellow in my
old age!"</p>

<p>Sir Martin shook his head. "Cowardice,
my lord? Nothing of the sort.
Prudence, I should call it. By the by,
the judge and a few others are coming
over." He chuckled softly. "We
thought we might talk you out of a
meal."</p>

<p>The Viceroy grinned widely.
"Nothing easier. I suspected all you
hangers-on would come around for
your handouts. Come along, my
friend; we'll have a drink before the
others get here."</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>There were nearly twenty people
at dinner, all, presumably, friends of
the Viceroy. At least, it is certain that
they were friends in so far as they
had no part in the assassination plot.
It was a gay party; the Viceroy's
friends were doing their best to cheer
him up, and were succeeding pretty
well. One of the nobles, known for
his wit, had just essayed a somewhat
off-color jest, and the others were
roaring with laughter at the punch
line when a shout rang out.</p>

<p>There was a sudden silence around
the table.</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked someone.
"What did&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Help!</i>" There was the sound of
footsteps pounding up the stairway
from the lower floor.</p>

<p>"<i>Help! The Southerners have
come to kill the Viceroy!</i>"</p>

<p>From the sounds, there was no
doubt in any of the minds of the
people seated around the table that
the shout was true. For a moment,
there was shock. Then panic took
over.</p>

<p>There were only a dozen or so
men in the attacking party; if the
"friends" of the Viceroy had stuck
by him, they could have held off the
assassins with ease.</p>

<p>But no one ran to lock the doors
that stood between the Viceroy and
his enemies, and only a few drew
their weapons to defend him. The
others fled. Getting out of a window
from the second floor of a building
isn't easy, but fear can lend wings,
and, although none of them actually
flew down, the retreat went fast
enough.</p>

<p>Characteristically, the Viceroy
headed, not for the window, but for
his own room, where his armor&mdash;long
unused, except for state functions&mdash;hung
waiting in the closet.
With him went Sir Martin.</p>

<p>But there wasn't even an opportunity
to get into the armor. The rebel
band charged into the hallway that
led to the bedroom, screaming:
"<i>Death to the Tyrant! Long live the
Emperor!</i>"</p>

<p>It was personal anger, then, not
rebellion against the Empire which
had appointed the ex-commander to
his post as Viceroy.</p>

<p>"Where is the Viceroy? Death to
the Tyrant!" The assassins moved
in.</p>

<p>Swords in hand, and cloaks wrapped
around their left arms, Sir Martin
and the Viceroy moved to meet
the oncoming attackers.</p>

<p>"Traitors!" bellowed the Viceroy.
"Cowards! Have you come to kill me
in my own house?"</p>

<p>Parry, thrust! Parry, thrust! Two
of the attackers fell before the snake-tongue
blade of the fighting Viceroy.
Sir Martin accounted for two more
before he fell in a flood of his own
blood.</p>

<p>The Viceroy was alone, now. His
blade flickered as though inspired,
and two more died under its tireless
onslaught. Even more would have
died if the head of the conspiracy,
a supporter of Young Jim named
Rada, hadn't pulled a trick that not
even the Viceroy would have pulled.</p>

<p>Rada grabbed one of his own men
and shoved him toward the Viceroy's
sword, impaling the hapless man upon
that deadly blade.</p>

<p>And, in the moment while the
Viceroy's weapon was buried to the
hilt in an enemy's body, the others
leaped around the dying man and
ran their blades through the Viceroy.</p>

<p>He dropped to the floor, blood
gushing from half a dozen wounds.</p>

<p>Even so, his fighting heart still
had seconds more to beat. As he
propped himself up on one arm, the
assassins stood back; even they recognized
that they had killed something
bigger and stronger than they.
A better man than any of them lay
dying at their feet.</p>

<p>He clawed with one hand at the
river of red that flowed from his
pierced throat and then fell forward
across the stone floor. With his crimson
hand, he traced the great symbol
of his Faith on the stone&mdash;the Sign
of the Cross. He bent his head to
kiss it, and, with a final cry of
"<i>Jesus!</i>" he died. At the age of
seventy, it had taken a dozen men
to kill him with treachery, something
all the hell of nine years of
conquest and rule had been unable
to do.</p>

<p>And thus died Francisco Pizarro,
the Conqueror of Peru.</p>

<p class="theend">THE END</p>

<hr />
<h2 class="lft"><b>To be read after you have finished
"Despoilers of the Golden Empire."</b></h2>

<p>Dear John,</p>

<p>It has been brought to my attention,
by those who have read the story,
that "Despoilers of the Golden Empire"
might conceivably be charged
with being a "reader cheater"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
that it does not play fair with the
reader, but leads him astray by means
of false statements. Naturally, I feel
it me bounden duty to refute such
scurrilous and untrue affronts, and
thus save meself from opprobrium.</p>

<p>Therefore, I address what follows
to the interested reader:</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that you must
have been misled when you read the
story; indeed, I'd be the last to deny it,
since I <i>intended</i> that you should be
misled. What I most certainly <i>do</i>
deny is any implication that such misleading
was accomplished by the telling
of untruths. A fiction writer is,
<i>by definition</i>, a professional liar; he
makes his living by telling interesting
lies on paper and selling the results
to the highest bidder for publication.
Since fiction writing is my livelihood,
I cannot and will not deny that I am
an accomplished liar&mdash;indeed, almost
an habitual one. Therefore, I feel
some small pique when, on the one
occasion on which I stick strictly to
the truth, I am accused of fraud. <i>Pfui!</i>
say I; I refute you. "I deny the allegation,
and I defy the alligator!"</p>

<p>To prove my case, I shall take several
examples from "Despoilers" and
show that the statements made are perfectly
valid. (Please note that I do
not claim any absolute accuracy for
such details as quoted dialogue, except
that none of the characters lies.
I simply contend that the story is as
accurate as any other good historical
novelette. I also might say here that
any resemblance between "Despoilers"
and any story picked at random
from the late lamented <i>Planet
Stories</i> is purely intentional and carefully
contrived.)</p>

<p>Take the first sentence:</p>

<p>"In the seven centuries that had
elapsed since the Second Empire had
been founded on the shattered remnants
of the First, the nobles of the
Imperium had come slowly to realize
that the empire was not to be judged
by the examples of its predecessor."</p>

<p>Perfectly true. By the time of the
Renaissance, the nobles of the Holy
Roman Empire knew that their empire
was not just a continuation of the
Roman Empire, but a new entity. The
old Roman Empire had collapsed in
the Sixth Century, and the <i>Holy</i>
Roman Empire, which was actually a
loose confederation of Germanic
states, did not come into being until
A. D. 800, when Karl der Grosse
(Charlemagne) was crowned emperor
by the Pope.</p>

<p>Anyone who wishes to quibble that
the date should be postponed for a
century and a half, until the time of
the German prince, Otto, may do so;
I will ignore him.</p>

<p>A few paragraphs later, I said:</p>

<p>"Without power, neither Civilization
nor the Empire could hold itself
together, and His Universal Majesty,
the Emperor Carl, well knew it. And
power was linked solidly to one element,
one metal ..."</p>

<p>The metal, as I said later on, was
Gold-197.</p>

<p>By "power," of course, I meant
political and economic power. In the
Sixteenth Century, that's what almost
anyone would have meant. If you
chose to interpret it as meaning "energy
per unit time," why, that's real
tough.</p>

<p>Why nail the "power metal" down
to an isotope of gold with an atomic
weight of 197? Because that's the only
naturally occurring isotope of gold.</p>

<p>The "Emperor Carl" was, of course,
Charles V, who also happened to be
King of Spain, and therefore Pizarro's
sovereign. I Germanicized his
name, as I did the others&mdash;Francisco
Pizarro becomes "Frank," et cetera&mdash;but
this is perfectly legitimate. After
all, the king's name in Latin, which
was used in all state papers, was
<i>Carolus</i>; the Spanish called him
<i>Carlos</i>, and history books in English
call him <i>Charles</i>. Either <i>Karl</i> or <i>Carl</i> is
just as legitimate as <i>Charles</i>, certainly,
and the same applies to the other
names in the story.</p>

<p>As to the title "His Universal
Majesty," that's exactly what he <i>was</i>
called. It is usually translated as "His
Catholic Majesty," but the word
<i>Catholic</i> comes from the Greek
<i>katholikos</i>, meaning "universal."
And, further on in the story, when
the term "Universal Assembly" is
used, it is a direct translation of the
Greek term, <i>Ekklesia Katholikos</i>, and
is actually a better translation than
"Catholic Church," since the English
word <i>church</i> comes from the Greek
<i>kyriakon</i>, meaning "the house of the
Lord"&mdash;in other words, a church
<i>building</i>, not the organization as a
whole.</p>

<p>Toward the end of Chapter One, I
wrote:</p>

<p>"Throughout the Empire, research
laboratories worked tirelessly at the
problem of transmuting commoner
elements into Gold-197, but thus far
none of the processes was commercially
feasible."</p>

<p>I think you will admit that the
alchemists never found a method of
transmuting the elements&mdash;certainly
none which was commercially feasible.</p>

<p>In Chapter Three, the statement
that Pizarro left his home&mdash;Spain&mdash;with
undermanned ships, and had to
sneak off illegally before the King's
inspectors checked up on him, is
historically accurate. And who can
argue with the statement that "there
wasn't a scientist worthy of the name
in the whole outfit"?</p>

<p>At the beginning of Chapter Four,
you'll find:</p>

<p>"Due to atmospheric disturbances,
the ship's landing was several hundred
miles from the point the commander
had originally picked ..." and "...
the ship simply wasn't built for atmospheric
navigation."</p>

<p>The adverse winds which drove
Pizarro's ships off course were certainly
"atmospheric disturbances," and I
defy anyone to prove that a Sixteenth
Century Spanish galleon was built for
atmospheric navigation.</p>

<p>And I insist that using the term
"carrier" instead of "horse," while
misleading, is not inaccurate. However,
I <i>would</i> like to know just what
sort of picture the term conjured up
in the reader's mind. In Chapter Ten,
in the battle scene, you'll find the following:</p>

<p>"The combination [of attackers
from both sides], plus the fact that
the heavy armor was a little unwieldy,
overbalanced him [the commander].
He toppled to the ground with a
clash of steel as he and the carrier
parted company.</p>

<p>"Without a human hand at its controls,
the carrier automatically moved
away from the mass of struggling
fighters and came to a halt well away
from the battle."</p>

<p>To be perfectly honest, it's somewhat
of a strain on my mind to imagine
anyone building a robot-controlled
machine as good as all that,
and then giving the drive such poor
protection that he can fall off of it.</p>

<p>One of the great screams from my
critics has been occasioned by the fact
that I referred several times to the
Spaniards as "Earthmen." I can't see
why. In order not to confuse the
reader, I invariably referred to them
as the "<i>invading</i> Earthmen," so as to
make a clear distinction between them
and the <i>native</i> Earthmen, or Incas,
who were native to Peru. If this be
treachery, then make the most of
it.</p>

<p>In other words, I contend that I
simply did what any other good detective
story writer tries to do&mdash;mislead
the reader without lying to him.
Agatha Christie's "The Murder of
Roger Ackroyd," for instance, uses
the device of telling the story from
the murderer's viewpoint, in the first
person, without revealing that he <i>is</i>
the murderer. Likewise, John Dickson
Carr, in his "Nine Wrong Answers"
finds himself forced to deny that he
has lied to the reader, although he admits
that one of his characters certainly
lied. Both Carr and Christie
told the absolute truth&mdash;within the
framework of the story&mdash;and left it
to the reader to delude himself.</p>

<p>It all depends on the viewpoint.
The statement, "We all liked Father
Goodheart very much" means one
thing when said by a member of his
old parish in the United States, which
he left to become a missionary. It
means something else again when uttered
by a member of the tribe of
cannibals which the good Father attempted
unsuccessfully to convert.</p>

<p>Similarly, such terms as "the gulf
between the worlds," "the new
world," and "the known universe"
have one meaning to a science-fictioneer,
and another to a historian.
Semantics, anyone?</p>

<p>In Chapter Ten, right at the beginning,
there is a conversation between
Commander Frank and Frater Vincent,
and "agent of the Assembly"
(read: <i>priest</i>). If the reader will go
back over that section, keeping in
mind the fact that what they are
"actually" talking about are the
Catholic Church and the Christian
religion <i>as seen from the viewpoint
of a couple of fanatically devout Sixteenth
Century Spaniards</i>, he will understand
the method I used in presenting
the whole story.</p>

<p>Let me quote:</p>

<p>"Mentally, the commander went
through the symbol-patterns that he
had learned as a child&mdash;the symbol-patterns
that brought him into direct
contact with the Ultimate Power, the
Power that controlled not only the
spinning of atoms and the whirling
of electrons in their orbits, but the
workings of probability itself."</p>

<p>Obviously, he is reciting the <i>Pater
Noster</i> and the <i>Ave Maria</i>. The rest
of the sentence is self-explanatory.</p>

<p>So is the following:</p>

<p>"Once indoctrinated into the teachings
of the Universal Assembly, any
man could tap that power to a greater
or lesser degree, depending on his
mental control and ethical attitude.
At the top level, a first-class adept
could utilize that Power for telepathy,
psychokinesis, levitation, teleportation,
and other powers that the commander
only vaguely understood."</p>

<p>It doesn't matter whether <i>you</i> believe
in the miracles attributed to
many of the Saints; Pizarro certainly
did. His faith in that Power was
as certain as the modern faith in the
power of the atomic bomb.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it was very
probably that hard, unyielding Faith
which made the Sixteenth Century
Spaniard the almost superhuman being
that he was. Only Spain of the Sixteenth
Century could have produced
the Conquistadors or such a man as
St. Ignatius Loyola, whose learned,
devout, and fanatically militant Society
of Jesus struck fear into the
hearts of Protestant and Catholic
Princes alike for the next two centuries.</p>

<p>The regular reader of Astounding
may remember that I gave another
example of the technique of truthful
misdirection in "The Best Policy,"
(July, 1957). An Earthman, captured
by aliens, finds himself in a position in
which he is unable to tell even the
smallest lie. But by telling the absolute
truth, he convinces the aliens that
<i>homo sapiens</i> is a race of super-duper
supermen. He does it so well that the
aliens surrender without attacking,
even before the rest of humanity is
aware of their existence.</p>

<p>The facts in "Despoilers of the
Golden Empire" remain. They <i>are</i>
facts. Francisco Pizarro and his men&mdash;an
army of less than two hundred&mdash;actually
<i>did</i> inflict appalling damage
on the Inca armies, even if they were
outnumbered ten to one, and with
astonishingly few losses of their own.
They did it with sheer guts, too; their
equipment was not too greatly superior
to that of the Peruvians, and by
the time they reached the Great Inca
himself, none of the Peruvians believed
that the invaders were demons
or gods. But in the face of the
Spaniards' determined onslaught, they
were powerless.</p>

<p>The assassination scene at the end
is almost an exact description of what
happened. It <i>did</i> take a dozen men in
full armor to kill the armorless
Pizarro, and even then it took trickery
and treachery to do it.</p>

<p>Now, just to show how fair I was&mdash;to
show how I scrupulously refrained
from lying&mdash;I will show what
a sacrifice I made for the sake of
truth.</p>

<p>If you'll recall, in the story, the
dying Pizarro traces the Sign of the
Cross on the floor in his own blood,
kisses it, and says "<i>Jesus!</i>" before he
dies. This is in strict accord with
every history on the subject I could
find.</p>

<p>But there is a legend to the effect
that his last words were somewhat different.
I searched the New York
Public Library for days trying to find
one single historian who would bear
out the legend; I even went so far as
to get a librarian who could read Spanish
and another whose German is
somewhat better than mine to translate
articles in foreign historical journals
for me. All in vain. But if I <i>could</i>
have substantiated the legend, the
final scene would have read something
like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Clawing at his sword-torn throat,
the fearless old soldier brought his
hand away coated with the crimson
of his own blood. Falling forward,
he traced the Sign of the Cross on
the stone floor in gleaming scarlet,
kissed it, and then glared up at the
men who surrounded him, his eyes
hard with anger and hate.</p>

<p>"I'm going to Heaven," he said,
his voice harsh and whispery. "And
<i>you</i>, you <i>bastards</i>, can go to <i>Hell</i>!"</p></div>

<p>It would have made one hell of an
ending&mdash;but it had to be sacrificed in
the interests of Truth.</p>

<p>So I rest my case.</p>

<p>I will even go further than that;
I defy anyone to point out a single
out-and-out lie in the whole story.
G'wan&mdash;I <i>dare</i> ya!</p>

<p>(SECRET ASIDE TO THE
READER; J. W. C., Jr., PLEASE
DO <i>NOT</i> READ!)</p>

<p>Ah, but wait! There <i>is</i> a villain in
the piece!</p>

<p><i>I</i> did not lie to you, no. But you
were lied to, all the same.</p>

<p>By whom?</p>

<p>By none less than that conniving
arch-fiend, John W. Campbell, Jr.,
that's who!</p>

<p>Wasn't it he who bought the story?</p>

<p>And wasn't it he who, with malice
aforethought, published it in a package
which was plainly labeled Science
Fiction?</p>

<p>And, therefore, didn't you have
every right to think it <i>was</i> science
fiction?</p>

<p>Sure you did!</p>

<p>I am guilty of nothing more than
weakness; my poor, frail sense of
ethics collapsed completely at the sight
of the bribe he offered me to become
a party to the dark conspiracy that
sprang from the depths of his own
demoniac mind. Ah, well; none of
us is perfect, I suppose.</p>
